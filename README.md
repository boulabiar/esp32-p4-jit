## 1. Executive Summary

The **ESP32-P4 JIT** is a sophisticated dynamic code loading system designed for the ESP32-P4 microcontroller. It enables developers to compile C/C++ code on a host PC and execute it natively on the ESP32-P4 without flashing the main firmware.

Unlike interpreted languages (MicroPython, Lua) or bytecode VMs (WASM), this system executes **native, optimized RISC-V machine code**. This ensures maximum performance, making it suitable for computationally intensive tasks like Digital Signal Processing (DSP), cryptography, or real-time control loops.

The system handles the entire lifecycle of dynamic execution:
1.  **Cross-Compilation**: Using the standard ESP-IDF RISC-V toolchain.
2.  **Linking**: Generating position-specific binaries for runtime-allocated memory.
3.  **Transport**: High-speed USB transfer.
4.  **Execution**: Safe invocation of code with automatic cache management.

## 2. System Architecture

The project follows a client-server model, split across the Host (PC) and the Device (ESP32-P4).

### 2.1 Host Build System (`esp32_loader`)
This is the "Compiler Driver". It is a Python package responsible for transforming C source code into a raw binary blob ready for the device.

*   **`Builder`**: The central orchestrator. It manages the build pipeline.
*   **`Compiler`**: Wraps `riscv32-esp-elf-gcc`. It handles flag management (`-march`, `-mabi`, `-O3`) to ensure the binary is compatible with the P4's hardware.
*   **`WrapperGenerator`**: A critical component that solves the ABI (Application Binary Interface) problem. It parses the user's C code using `pycparser`, extracts function signatures, and generates a C wrapper (`temp.c`). This wrapper reads arguments from a fixed memory buffer, casts them to the correct types, calls the user function, and writes the result back.
*   **`LinkerGenerator`**: Dynamically creates GNU Linker scripts (`.ld`). It takes a base address as input and generates a script that links the code to run *specifically* at that address.
*   **`BinaryProcessor`**: Extracts the `.text`, `.data`, and `.rodata` sections from the compiled ELF file. Crucially, it also handles `.bss` (uninitialized data) by appending zero-padding to the binary, ensuring that global variables are correctly initialized when loaded.

### 2.2 Host Runtime (`p4_jit`)
This is the "Client Library". It manages the connection to the device and the logic of the JIT session.

*   **`DeviceManager`**: Implements the custom binary protocol over USB Serial (CDC-ACM). It maintains a **Shadow Allocation Table** on the host. This table tracks every memory region allocated on the device. If the user tries to write to or execute an address that wasn't allocated, the `DeviceManager` blocks the request locally, preventing segmentation faults or crashes on the embedded device.
*   **`JITSession`**: Provides the high-level API. It abstracts the connection process (auto-discovery via `PING`) and the function loading process.

### 2.3 Device Firmware (`p4_jit_firmware`)
This is the "Server". It is a specialized ESP-IDF application running on the ESP32-P4.

*   **USB Transport**: Built on top of **TinyUSB**. It uses FreeRTOS StreamBuffers to decouple the high-priority USB Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) from the lower-priority protocol task. This ensures that even if the protocol task is busy, incoming USB data is buffered and not lost.
*   **Command Dispatcher**: Parses incoming packets and executes commands (`ALLOC`, `WRITE`, `EXEC`).
*   **Memory Manager**: Wraps `heap_caps_aligned_alloc` to provide memory from specific regions (PSRAM vs SRAM) with specific capabilities (Executable, DMA-capable, etc.).

---

## 3. The JIT Workflow (The "Two-Pass" Mechanism)

A fundamental challenge in dynamic loading is **Address Resolution**. When code is compiled, jumps and data references must point to valid memory addresses.
*   **Static Linking**: Addresses are known at compile time (standard firmware).
*   **Position Independent Code (PIC)**: Addresses are calculated relative to the Program Counter (PC). This is complex on embedded systems (requires GOT/PLT).
*   **Position Specific Code**: Code is linked for a specific address. This is efficient but requires knowing the address *before* linking.

We chose **Position Specific Code** for performance and simplicity. This necessitates a **Two-Pass Workflow**:

### Phase 1: The Probe (Discovery)
1.  **Compile**: The host compiles the code using a **Dummy Address** (e.g., `0x00000000`).
2.  **Measure**: The resulting binary is invalid for execution, but its **Size** is correct. We extract:
    *   `Code Size`: Total size of instructions + data + BSS.
    *   `Args Size`: Size needed for the argument passing buffer.

### Phase 2: Allocation (Reservation)
1.  **Request**: The host sends an `ALLOC` command to the device for the measured sizes.
2.  **Allocate**: The device allocates memory in the requested region (e.g., PSRAM).
3.  **Return**: The device returns the **Physical Addresses** (e.g., Code=`0x40081234`, Args=`0x3FC05678`).

### Phase 3: The Final Build (Linking)
1.  **Re-Compile**: The host recompiles the *exact same source*.
2.  **Link**: The `LinkerGenerator` creates a script with `ORIGIN = 0x40081234`.
3.  **Output**: The linker resolves all symbols relative to `0x40081234`. The binary is now valid.

### Phase 4: Execution (Runtime)
1.  **Upload**: The host writes the binary to `0x40081234`.
2.  **Execute**: The host sends an `EXEC` command. The device jumps to `0x40081234`.

## 5. Usage Guide

### 5.1 Hello World (Simple Calculation)

```python
from esp32_loader import Builder
from p4_jit import JITSession
from p4_jit.memory_caps import MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM, MALLOC_CAP_8BIT
import struct

# 1. Connect
session = JITSession()
session.connect()

# 2. Create Source
with open("math.c", "w") as f:
    f.write("int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }")

# 3. Probe (Pass 1)
builder = Builder()
temp_bin = builder.wrapper.build_with_wrapper(
    source="math.c", function_name="add",
    base_address=0, arg_address=0
)

# 4. Allocate
# Code needs EXEC capability. Args need DATA capability.
code_addr = session.device.allocate(temp_bin.total_size + 64, MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM | MALLOC_CAP_8BIT, 128)
args_addr = session.device.allocate(128, MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM | MALLOC_CAP_8BIT, 128)

# 5. Final Build (Pass 2)
final_bin = builder.wrapper.build_with_wrapper(
    source="math.c", function_name="add",
    base_address=code_addr, arg_address=args_addr
)

# 6. Upload & Load
remote_func = session.load_function(final_bin, args_addr)

# 7. Execute
# Pack arguments: two integers (4 bytes each)
args = struct.pack("<ii", 10, 20)
remote_func(args)

# 8. Read Result
# Result is always at the last 4 bytes of the args buffer (slot 31)
res_bytes = session.device.read_memory(args_addr + 124, 4)
result = struct.unpack("<i", res_bytes)[0]
print(f"10 + 20 = {result}")
```

### 5.2 Working with Arrays

Passing pointers requires allocating the data buffer on the device first.

```python
# 1. Prepare Data
data = [1, 2, 3, 4]
data_bytes = struct.pack("<4i", *data)

# 2. Allocate Data Buffer
data_addr = session.device.allocate(len(data_bytes), MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM | MALLOC_CAP_8BIT, 128)
session.device.write_memory(data_addr, data_bytes)

# 3. Compile Function
# int sum(int *arr, int len) { ... }
# ... (Two-Pass Build omitted for brevity) ...

# 4. Call
# Pass the POINTER (address) and LENGTH
args = struct.pack("<Ii", data_addr, 4)
remote_func(args)
```

## 8. Internals & Design Decisions

### 8.1 Why Position Specific Code?
We avoided Position Independent Code (PIC) because:
1.  **Performance**: PIC requires indirect addressing via a Global Offset Table (GOT), which adds instruction overhead.
2.  **Complexity**: Implementing a dynamic linker on the ESP32 to resolve GOT entries at runtime is complex and error-prone.
3.  **Simplicity**: By linking for a specific address, we get standard, optimized machine code that just works, provided we load it at the right place.

### 8.2 Automatic ABI Wrapping
The ESP32-P4 uses the RISC-V ILP32F ABI (arguments in registers `a0`-`a7`, `fa0`-`fa7`). Python cannot easily set CPU registers remotely.
**Solution**: We use a "Shared Memory" approach.
1.  Host writes args to a memory buffer.
2.  We generate a C wrapper that:
    *   Reads from the buffer.
    *   Casts data to the correct types (handling float bit-patterns).
    *   Calls the target function (compiler handles register allocation).
    *   Writes the result back to the buffer.

### 8.3 Cache Coherency & Safety
The ESP32-P4 has separate Instruction (I) and Data (D) caches.
*   When we `WRITE` code, it goes through the D-Cache to RAM.
*   The I-Cache might still contain stale data for that address.
*   **Critical Step**: The firmware calls `esp_cache_msync()` with `ESP_CACHE_MSYNC_FLAG_INVALIDATE`. This forces the D-Cache to flush to RAM and invalidates the I-Cache, ensuring the CPU fetches the new instructions.

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Error | Likely Cause | Solution |
|:------|:-------------|:---------|
| `Device not connected` | USB issue or Port busy | Check cable, close other terminals (Putty/TeraTerm). |
| `PermissionError` | Host-side safety check | You are writing to an address you didn't `allocate()`. |
| `IllegalInstruction` | Cache incoherency | Ensure `esp_cache_msync` is working. Check `-march` in config. |
| `LoadProhibited` | Null pointer dereference | Check your C code. |
| `Linker Error` | Code size > Allocation | Increase allocation size (add padding). |
