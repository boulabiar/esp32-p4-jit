    config P4_JIT_TASK_STACK_SIZE
        int "JIT Task Stack Size"
        default 8192
        help
            Stack size for the task handling USB protocol and JIT commands.

    config P4_JIT_TASK_PRIORITY
        int "JIT Task Priority"
        default 5
        help
            Priority of the JIT task. Higher number = higher priority.

    config P4_JIT_TASK_CORE_ID
        int "JIT Task Core ID"
        default 1
        range -1 1
        help
            Core to pin the JIT task to. -1 = No Affinity, 0 = Core 0, 1 = Core 1.
            Pinning to Core 1 is recommended to leave Core 0 for Wi-Fi/System.

    config P4_JIT_PAYLOAD_BUFFER_SIZE
        int "JIT Payload Buffer Size"
        default 1048576
        help
            Size of the RX/TX buffers for JIT commands (default 1MB).
            These are used to hold the code/data being transferred.
            Allocated from PSRAM if available.

    config P4_JIT_STREAM_BUFFER_SIZE
        int "USB Stream Buffer Size"
        default 16384
        help
            Size of the internal FreeRTOS StreamBuffer for USB ISR (default 16KB).
            This is a small FIFO and should be kept relatively small (e.g. 16KB-64KB).
